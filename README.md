- Hi, Iâ€™m @ImprovedDungeonRooms
- The original Dungeon Rooms mod has caused multiple crashes to me and other players and while it is very useful, I had to remove it. I have mainly focused on improving the stability, reliability, performance and cheeses while sacrificing file size and load time.
- Please note that this requires essential (https://essential.gg/en/) to work. Without it, many features including the automatic routing finder will not work.
- Features added:
- Auto Routing finds the most efficient method to get to blood room once it is open (toggleable)
- Neu map support
