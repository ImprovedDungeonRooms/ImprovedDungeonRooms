- Hi, I’m @ImprovedDungeonRooms
- I’m interested in improving the stability, reliability, performance and cheeses in the commonly used Dungeon Rooms mod
- I’m currently learning c++ and improving my java coding skills
- I’m looking to collaborate on a mod for the Nether Island once it releases
- Please note that this requires essential to work and may result in a slower loading time than the normal Dungeon Rooms mod
