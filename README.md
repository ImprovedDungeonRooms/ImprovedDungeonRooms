- Hi, Iâ€™m @ImprovedDungeonRooms
- The original Dungeon Rooms mod has caused me multiple performance issues and while it is very useful, I had to stop using it. I have slowly optimized it for my personal use but have met other players who had issues running the mod. I have mainly focused on improving the stability, reliability, performance and cheeses while sacrificing file size and initial load time.
- Please note that this requires essential (https://essential.gg/en/) to work. Without it, many features including the automatic routing finder will not work.
- Features added:
- Auto Routing finds the most efficient method to get to blood room once it is open (toggleable)
- Neu map support
